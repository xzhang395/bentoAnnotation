                        <div class="landing-wrap ">

                            <p>To complement its stellar CMOS sensor and powerful processing abilities, the EOS 5D Mark IV camera
                                incorporates a 61-point High Density Reticular AF II system. It features up to 41 cross-type
                                points and an extensive AF area that extends well into the top and bottom of the peripheral
                                frame.
                                <br>Low-light performance is phenomenal – the AF system’s low-intensity limit is EV -3 at the
                                center AF point and all 61 AF points are compatible down to f/8 for excellent low-light performance,
                                even with lens extenders attached. To help ensure that AF points and other shooting information
                                are visible at a glance, the EOS 5D Mark IV also features Canon’s Intelligent Viewfinder
                                II for a bright, customizable view.</p>

                            <p>The iSA Intelligent Scene Analysis system uses its own RGB+IR light sensor with an approximately
                                150,000-pixel resolution to provide the camera with immense image analysis in an instant,
                                making necessary corrections along the way. The sensor enables Canon’s anti-flicker function,
                                which detects the frequency and phase of a light source’s flicker (such as a fluorescent
                                light) and captures images near the point of peak brightness when the subject is most likely
                                to be well-illuminated.
                                <br>The EOS 5D Mark IV also incorporates Canon’s Intelligent Tracking and Recognition system
                                (iTR AF) that detects and tracks subjects, automatically switching the AF point to optimize
                                tracking.</p>

                            <p>The EOS 5D Mark IV’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system enables capture of Dual Pixel Raw (DPRAW) files***.
                                Images shot as DPRAWs have additional adjustment possibilities when processed with Canon’s
