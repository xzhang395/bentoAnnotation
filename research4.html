                    <h1>10 Facts about Millennials That Every Retailer Should Know</h1>
                <div class="post">
                    <p>While there is no universal definition of exactly when the Millennial generation begins or ends, although
                        the general consensus is that it encompasses those born between 1980 and 2000, it is unanimously
                        understood that Millennials will shake the retail world to its core… more than they already have.</p>

                    <p>The Millennial generation is often labeled as one big block, but it is vital for retailer’s to remember
                        that this generation is comprised of people in many different life stages as these life stages affect
                        what they want, what marketing messages resonate with them and how they shop. Fourteen-year-olds
                        shop differently than 21-year-olds and 21-year-olds shop differently than 30-year-olds.</p>

                    <p>And much to retailers’ dismay, even though Millennials are the first truly digital generation, when it
                        comes to shopping, Millennials are still interested in the in-store experience.</p>

                    <p>Even though you’ve probably read about Millennials until you’re blue in the face, truly understanding
                        this complex generation has huge implications for your business.</p>

                    <p>Here are 10 reasons why:</p>

                    <p>1. There are anywhere between 80 and 95 million Millennials, comprising roughly 30% of the population.
                        (Source:
                        <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-facts-2014-5" style="font-size: 1.6rem; line-height: normal;">Business Insider</a>)</p>

                    <p>2. Millennials are starting to come into their prime spending years. As Millennials age into their 30s,
                        they will be an increasingly important consumer group.</p>

                    <p>3. By 2018, Millennials will have more spending power than the Baby Boomers and by 2020 Millennials will
                        have a collective spending power of $1.4 trillion. (Source:

                    <p>4. Millennials are the most ethnically and racially diverse generation, with 19% being Hispanic, 14%
                        African-American and 5% Asian. (Source:
                        <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/traditional/demographic-stats-about-us-millennials-40016/">Marketing Charts</a>)</p>

                    <p>5. Millennials love to spend money – especially on apparel. Roughly 58% of Millennials say they “love
                        to shop” compared to 40% of adults overall; they spend 8% more on apparel than those aged 35-44 and
                        Millennial women are 83% more likely to really enjoy clothes shopping than other cohorts. (Source:

                    <p>6. 81% of Millennials’ retail spending occurs in brick and mortar stores and 57% of Millennial in-store
                        shoppers make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>7. 53% of Millennials shop in-store during the typical week and account for more than one-third of all
                        U.S. shopping visits.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>8. Millennials spend an average of $75 per online visit and an average of $57 per in-store visit.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>9. Millennials make up 58% of mobile shoppers and are 2.5 times more likely than the average shopper
                        to be influenced by a mobile app. And shockingly, 53% of Millennials said they would rather give
                        up their sense of smell than their technology.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>10. Millennials love social media. They have grown up in a social media revolution and embraced it with
                        arms wide open – 43% of Millennials have liked more than 43 brands on Facebook, 63% stay up-to-date
                        on brands via social media and 44% are willing to promote brands on their social networks.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The bottom line is that the future will be defined by the Millennial generation. They will be the force
                        that drives the rejuvenation of the U.S. economy, challenges long-held traditions, pushes for increased
                        productivity and demands innovation. &nbsp;</p>
